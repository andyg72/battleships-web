#Batleships Web

This was the Makers Academy week three exercise, building on week two's exercise of generating the logic of the battleships game in Ruby, to bring it to life with a web front end built with Sinatra and utilising Cucumber / Capybara for test driven development.

This was our first piece of work that encompassed front end.

During the challenge week little progress was made as we battled with our understanding of Sinatra and making it fit with a game logic built without a concept of the front end.

However I subsequently continued to work on the codebase to drive it to a full playable game.

###Technologies

###Playing the game

The game is deployed on heroku [Andy's Battleships](http://battleshipsandy.herokuapp.com/ "Andy's Battleships")

or alternatively you can clone the repository, navigate into the top level directory `$ rackup` and open [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292)

###Tests

Unit tested with Rspec `$ rspec`
Feature tested with Cucumber / Capybara `$ cucumber`
