#Battleships-Web

This was our week three challenge at Makers Academy done as a pair project with @emilysas

The objective was to create a web application (with Sinatra, tested in Cucumber and Capybara) out of the battleships game logic we had created in Ruby the previous week (see battleships repository).

This was our first experience with Sinatra / Cucumber / Capybara.

It wasn't very successful for the following reasons (from our retrospective);

- the underlying Ruby code that was created (by @andyg72 and @bebbs) the previous week wasn't structured with the best SOLID principles to enable front end development (we hadn't done any front end development previously).
- the statelessness of the web especially conflicted with how the ruby code had been designed and it was our first experience of understanding the limitations that this brought.
- we got stuck into the code too quickly without taking regular steps back from the code face to review progress.

However because of these issues we learnt alot, whilst not completing the task.

#Next steps
@andyg72 continue to plug away with the application and through 'spike' development (not test driven :( ) completed a functioning game. 

This functioning game is stored in the new branch of this repository.
